        Arithmetic Operators
        ->    +  -  *  /  %(modulo)  ++(increment)   --(decrement)

        Relational Operators{generally used for comparison}
        ->    ==(is equal to)
        ->    !=(is not equal to)
        ->    < (greater than)    and    > (less than)
        ->    <= (greater than or equals to)    and    >= (less than or equal to)

        Logical Operators
        ->      &&(logical AND)
        ->      ||(logical OR)
        ->      !(logical NOT)

        Assignment Operators
        ->      =   +=  -=  /=  %=

        Unary Operators{operators that required only one operand}
        ->      +(unary plus)
        ->      -(unary minus)
        ->      ++(increment operator)
                    post-increment
                    pre-increment
        ->      --(decrement operator)
                    post-decrement
                    pre-decrement
        ->      ! (logical complement operator)

        Bitwise Operators{checks each binary bit / operates on bit level}
        ->      | (Bitwise OR)
                    if any one bit is 1, then output will be 1

        ->      & (Bitwise AND)
                    if all the bits are 1, then only output will be 1

        ->      ^ (Bitwise exclusive OR or XOR)
                    if two bits are same then the output will be 0
                    if two bits are different then the output will be 1

        ->      ~ (Bitwise Complement or NOT)
                    inverts all the bits

        ->      << (left shift)             a << b = a * 2^b
                    shifts bits to left
        ->      >> (right shift)
                    shifts bits to right
